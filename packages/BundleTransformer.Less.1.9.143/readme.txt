   DESCRIPTION
   ===========
   BundleTransformer.Less contains translator-adapter `LessTranslator` (supports
   LESS (http://lesscss.org) version 2.7.2). This adapter makes translation of
   LESS-code to CSS-code. Also contains debugging HTTP-handler `LessAssetHandler`,
   which is responsible for text output of translated LESS-asset.

   BundleTransformer.Less does not support loading of plugins.

   As a JS-engine is used the JavaScript Engine Switcher library
   (http://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher). For correct working of
   this module is recommended to install one of the following NuGet packages:
   JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Msie, JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8 or
   JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.ChakraCore.

   POST-INSTALL ACTIONS
   ====================
   For correct working of this module is recommended to install one of the
   following NuGet packages: JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.Msie,
   JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.V8 or JavaScriptEngineSwitcher.ChakraCore.
   After package is installed and JS-engine is registered
   (http://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher/wiki/Registration-of-JS-engines),
   need set a name of JavaScript engine (for example, `MsieJsEngine`) to the `name`
   attribute of `/configuration/bundleTransformer/less/jsEngine` configuration
   element.

   To use a debugging HTTP-handler in the IIS Classic mode, you need add to the
   `/configuration/system.web/httpHandlers` element of the Web.config file a
   following code:

   <add
	path="*.less" verb="GET"
	type="BundleTransformer.Less.HttpHandlers.LessAssetHandler, BundleTransformer.Less" />
